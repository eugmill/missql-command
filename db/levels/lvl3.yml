    content: "<p>So now we know how to return a single column, and we know how to return all the columns. But so far our queries have been returning data for every single row in the table.</p><p>This time, let's try getting more specific and returning only the particular rows where certain conditions are met. For instance, what if I just want to get populations, but only for New York or Paris?</p><p>One way to do that is with a <code>WHERE</code> clause. A <code>WHERE</code> clause filters the results based on certain criteria."

    content: "<p>So how do we use it? The general syntax is:</p><p><code>SELECT <em>columns</em> FROM <em>table</em> WHERE <em>condition</em>;</code></p><p>While it seems pretty basic, you can make the condition as complex as you need it to be. For example, you can combine conditions using boolean operators such as <code>AND</code> , <code>NOT</code> , and <code>OR</code>. For number columns you can also filter by using the <code><</code>,<code>></code>,<code>=</code>,<code><=</code>,<code>>=</code> operators.<p><p>Here is an example:</p><p><code>SELECT * FROM cities WHERE population >8000000;</code></p>"

    content: "<p>The Following are all valid queries:</p><p><code>SELECT name FROM cities WHERE name='New York' OR name='Paris';</code></p><p><code>SELECT * FROM cities WHERE NOT name='New York'</code></p><p>Now you give it a try. Go ahead and get the list of cities whose name is New York or whose population is over 10,000,000. We'll want all the columns.</p><p>Feel free to break up your query into multiple lines to make it easier.<p><p>Tip: <code>SQL</code> strings (like the <code>VARCHAR</code> datatype) are specified with 'single quotes' rather than \"double quotes\". We'll dive deeper into varchar and other datatypes in the next level. </p>"
