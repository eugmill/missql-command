    content: "<p>We've figured out how to pull data out from tables, but where did the tables come from?</p><p>To make sense of table creation, we'll first take a step back. SQL statements can be put into two categories, the <em>Data Definition Language</em> (DDL) and the <em>Data Manipulation Language</em> (DML).<p><p>DDL statements change the <em>structures</em> that data is stored in, while DML statements read and manipulate the data itself.</p><p>For instance, creating, deleting and altering a table's columns are all part of the DDL because they change the structure of our tables. Selecting, inserting, and updating data within tables falls under DML.</p>"

    content: "<p>With that out of the way, let's learn our first DDL command: <code>CREATE</code>!</p><p><code>CREATE</code> lets us make a table by defining which columns that table will have, and what kind of data they will store.</p><p>The description of a database's tables, columns and relations is called the database <em>schema</em>. You can see a basic sample schema in the panel above your input box. This is the format for the cities table.</p><p>If you take a look you'll see the names for two columns with their datatypes beside them. </p>"

    content: "<p>The datatype literally indicates what type of data a column can store, and how much of it. Different SQL databases have different data types available to them, but some generally available datatypes are things like text, numbers, dates, and true/false boolean values.</p>"

    content: "<p>The first column of the cities table is 'name', and its datatype is <code>varchar(255)</code>. This is just SQL's way of indicating that a column can store text (<em>variable characters</em>), but that the storage is limited to 255 characters. So a <code>varchar(140)</code> column would be able to store exactly a single tweet, but no more.</p><p>The second column, <code>population</code>, is an <code>integer</code> datatype, which stores a number without a decimal value attached.</p><p>So let's put this all together and create our <code>cities</code> table!The basic syntax for a <code>CREATE</code> statement is:</p><p><pre><code>CREATE TABLE <em>tablename</em> (\n  <em>column1 TYPE1,\n  column2 TYPE2</em>\n);</code></pre></p>"

    content: "<p>Here are some examples:</p><p><pre><code>CREATE TABLE people (\n  name VARCHAR(64),\n  age INTEGER\n);</code></pre></p><p><pre><code>CREATE TABLE bank_accounts (\n  account_number INTEGER,\n  balance INTEGER\n);</code></pre></p><p>Now go ahead and try to create the cities table.</p><p>Use the schema to the right if you get stuck.</p>"
