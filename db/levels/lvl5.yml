    content: "<p>Say we have a table called <code>cats</code> that stores the name and color of each cat. To add a new cat to the table, we would use a statement like the following:</p><p><pre><code>INSERT INTO cats\n  VALUES ('Polly','red');</code></pre></p><p>Columns are listed in the order of their definition. To specify the column for each value, or to insert a row without a value for every column, we would use a query like the following:</p><p><pre><code>INSERT INTO cats (color, name)\n  VALUES ('red, 'Polly');</code></pre><br /> Notice how we were able to swap the order of the columns by explicitly specifying their name and order after the table's name.</p><p>Now, try adding a new row to the missiles table for our new Topol missile!"
